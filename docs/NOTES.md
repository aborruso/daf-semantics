The simple diagrams are created using the online tool [draw.io](http://draw.io).
It's possible to [load](https://www.draw.io/#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fseralf%2Fdaf-semantics%2Fmaster%2Fdocs%2Fsemantic_manager-v3.xml) the latest version of the figure, edit it, then save the improved version for a later commit.
